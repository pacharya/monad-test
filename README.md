# INTRO

Given a movie service and a actor service, implement a catalog service that will
return a `Map[String, List[Actor]]` from a `List[movieID]`. Please implement 
`CatalogService`. Use the `SimpleMovieService` and `SimpleActorService` for 
concrete implementations of those. Please write any unit tests appropriate
